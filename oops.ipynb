        "OOPS ASSIGNMENT\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\" which contain both data (attributes) and methods (functions). It promotes code reuse, modularity, and scalability using principles like encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with state (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "Abstraction: Hides complex implementation and shows only essential features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: Restricts access to internal details using access modifiers (like private/protected).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Dunder (double underscore) methods like __init__, __str__, __repr__ are special methods that begin and end with double underscores. They enable operator overloading and custom object behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "Inheritance allows one class (child) to acquire properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (parent), promoting code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism means \"many forms\"—it allows methods to have different implementations depending on the object invoking them (e.g., method overriding).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Encapsulation is achieved using:\n",
        "\n",
        "Public: var\n",
        "\n",
        "Protected: _var\n",
        "\n",
        "Private: __var\n",
        "This controls visibility and access to class members.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "A constructor is a special method __init__() that is automatically called when an object is created to initialize attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "@classmethod: Takes cls as the first argument and can modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod: Doesn’t take self or cls; behaves like a regular function inside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "Python does not support method overloading natively. You can simulate it using default arguments or *args, **kwargs.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "When a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "@property allows a method to be accessed like an attribute. Useful for controlled access to private variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "It promotes flexibility and integration—functions can work with objects of different classes using a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "An abstract class (defined using the abc module) cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "Code reusability\n",
        "\n",
        "Modularity\n",
        "\n",

        "Maintainability\n",
        "\n",
        "Real-world modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "When a class inherits from more than one parent class. Python supports it using the C3 Linearization (MRO) algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "Class variable: Shared across all instances (defined outside __init__)\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance variable: Unique to each instance (defined inside __init__)\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "__str__: Returns a human-readable string for print().\n",
        "\n",
        "__repr__: Returns an unambiguous representation for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "super() gives access to methods of the parent class, often used in inheritance to call the superclass’s constructor or methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "__del__ is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed. It’s used for cleanup (e.g., closing files).\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "Feature\t@staticmethod\t@classmethod\n",
        "First parameter\tNone\tcls (class itself)\n",
        "Can access class state\tNo\tYes\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "Polymorphism allows a child class to override a parent class method. The same method name behaves differently based on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "Method chaining is calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line (by returning self from each method).\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy\n",
        "Edit\n",
        "obj.set_name(\"John\").set_age(30)\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "It makes an object callable like a function. Define __call__() in a class to allow instances to be invoked with ().\n",
